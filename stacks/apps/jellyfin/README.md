# Jellyfin Stack

## Access

Dual-domain routing via `deploy.labels` (two routers: `jellyfin-external` and `jellyfin-internal`).

## GPU Passthrough

Docker Swarm does not support `devices:` in service specs (SwarmKit issue #1244, open since 2016, unresolved). Without `--device`, containers lack the cgroup device whitelist needed to access `/dev/dri/*` character devices (major 226). Bind-mounting `/dev/dri:/dev/dri` creates the mount point but the kernel's cgroup device controller blocks access — the device files appear as "No such file or directory" inside the container.

### What Doesn't Work

| Approach | Why It Fails |
|----------|-------------|
| `devices:` in compose | Stripped by `docker stack deploy` — not supported in Swarm |
| `device-cgroup-rules` in daemon.json | Not a valid daemon.json option — Docker rejects it and fails to start |
| `--default-cgroup-rule` dockerd flag | Does not exist in Docker Engine |
| CDI (Container Device Interface) | Works with `docker run` only — Swarm has no mechanism to pass CDI device requests |
| `privileged: true` | Not supported in Swarm stack files |
| AMD Container Runtime Toolkit | Targets Instinct datacenter GPUs with ROCm — incompatible with consumer RDNA APUs |

### Host Node Setup

**1. udev rule** — persistent device permissions across reboots:

```
/etc/udev/rules.d/99-dri.rules

KERNEL=="card[0-9]*", SUBSYSTEM=="drm", MODE="0666"
KERNEL=="renderD*", SUBSYSTEM=="drm", MODE="0666"
```

Apply without reboot: `udevadm trigger`

**2. daemon.json** — GPU resource advertising for Swarm scheduler:

```json
{
  "node-generic-resources": ["gpu=1"]
}
```

No custom runtime needed. No Docker restart required for the udev change.

### How It Works

The real blocker is the cgroup device controller, not the bind mount. Docker's `--device` flag does two things: creates the device node AND adds a cgroup allow rule. Swarm's bind mount only does the first. The udev rule sidesteps the second by making the devices world-accessible at the OS level, before Docker's cgroup layer gets involved.

- udev rule: Makes `/dev/dri/*` world-accessible (`0666`), bypassing cgroup device restrictions
- `/dev/dri:/dev/dri` bind mount in compose: Exposes device nodes inside the container
- `node-generic-resources`: Advertises GPU availability to Swarm scheduler
- `generic_resources` in compose: Requests GPU from scheduler, prevents oversubscription
- Placement constraint `gpu == true`: Ensures service runs on GPU node

### Security

`MODE="0666"` grants all containers on the GPU node access to `/dev/dri`. Acceptable here because only jellyfin is constrained to the GPU node. If other services are added to that node, evaluate whether GPU access should be restricted.

## Custom Image

The base `jellyfin/jellyfin` image ships Mesa drivers that predate RDNA 3.5 (gfx1150) support. The Dockerfile installs newer drivers from Debian backports to enable hardware transcoding on the Radeon 890M.

### What It Installs

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mesa-va-drivers` | VAAPI decode/encode (radeonsi) |
| `mesa-vulkan-drivers` | Vulkan video decode/encode (RADV) |
| `mesa-opencl-icd` | Rusticl OpenCL 3.0 (GPU-accelerated HDR tone mapping) |
| `libva2`, `libva-drm2` | VA-API runtime libraries |
| `libdrm2`, `libdrm-amdgpu1` | DRM/amdgpu kernel interface |
| `libllvm*` (newest available) | LLVM backend for shader compilation |

After installing, the Dockerfile replaces Jellyfin's bundled `radeonsi_drv_video.so` with the newer Gallium library from Mesa backports. Content-hash tagging via `swarm:deploy` — Dockerfile changes automatically produce new image tags.

### Why Rusticl

Mesa 25.2 removed the legacy Clover OpenCL backend. `mesa-opencl-icd` now contains only Rusticl (`libRusticlOpenCL.so`), providing OpenCL 3.0 with image support on radeonsi. Required for `tonemap_opencl` in jellyfin-ffmpeg.

Rusticl requires `RUSTICL_ENABLE=radeonsi` in the container environment to advertise the GPU as an OpenCL device. Without it, no OpenCL platform is registered and ffmpeg's OpenCL init fails.

## Hardware Acceleration

### GPU Hardware

AMD Ryzen AI 9 HX PRO 370 (Strix Point) with Radeon 890M iGPU (RDNA 3.5, gfx1150).

### Driver Stack

| Layer | Driver | Version |
|-------|--------|---------|
| DRM | amdgpu | 3.57.0 |
| VAAPI | Mesa Gallium (radeonsi) | 25.2.6 |
| Vulkan | RADV PHOENIX | 25.2.6 |
| OpenCL | Rusticl (radeonsi) | OpenCL 3.0 |
| LLVM | — | 19.1.7 |

### Codec Support

| Codec | VAAPI Decode | VAAPI Encode |
|-------|:------------:|:------------:|
| H.264 (High) | Yes | Yes |
| HEVC (Main) | Yes | Yes |
| HEVC (Main 10) | Yes | Yes |
| AV1 (Main) | Yes | Yes |
| VP9 (Profile 0) | Yes | No |
| VP9 (Profile 2) | Yes | No |
| JPEG Baseline | Yes | No |

### GPU Processing Filters

| Filter | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `scale_vaapi` (resize on GPU) | Works |
| `deinterlace_vaapi` | Works |
| `overlay_vaapi` | Works |
| `tonemap_opencl` (HDR → SDR) | Works (via Rusticl) |
| `tonemap_vaapi` (HDR → SDR) | Fails — Mesa radeonsi VPP lacks HDR support |

### HDR Tone Mapping

`tonemap_vaapi` is not available — Mesa's radeonsi VAAPI driver does not expose VPP HDR capabilities. Two working alternatives:

**1. `tonemap_opencl` via Rusticl (preferred)** — tone mapping kernel runs on GPU:

```
VAAPI decode → hwdownload → hwupload (OpenCL) → tonemap_opencl → hwdownload → hwupload_vaapi → VAAPI encode
```

**2. `tonemapx` CPU fallback** — SIMD-optimized software tone mapping (AVX2+FMA3):

```
VAAPI decode → hwdownload → tonemapx (CPU) → hwupload → VAAPI encode
```

Both require a round-trip through system memory because Rusticl lacks VA-API interop (`cl_intel_va_api_media_sharing` is Intel-specific, and DRM-to-OpenCL device derivation is not implemented in Rusticl). Zero-copy VAAPI ↔ OpenCL mapping is not possible.

### Vulkan Video

Vulkan video extensions are available (decode: H.264, H.265, AV1; encode: H.264, H.265) with dedicated decode/encode queue families. Not currently used by Jellyfin's transcoding pipeline but available for future ffmpeg Vulkan video support.

### What Doesn't Exist

| Feature | Why |
|---------|-----|
| VP9 VAAPI encode | No `EncSlice` entrypoint in radeonsi — hardware limitation |
| JPEG VAAPI encode | No encode entrypoint for JPEG Baseline |
| `tonemap_vulkan` filter | Does not exist as an ffmpeg filter |
| OpenCL zero-copy interop | Rusticl lacks VA-API/DRM device derivation for ffmpeg |
